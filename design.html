            Designing a flag is more than arranging shapes and colors – it's about creating a powerful symbol that resonates with identity, unity, and purpose. Every element, from the choice of colors to the placement of patterns, carries meaning and tells a story.

            Attempts to create design guidelines

              Throughout history, many have sought to establish guidelines for effective flag design, recognizing the importance of creating symbols that are visually impactful, meaningful, and enduring. While flag design has often been shaped by tradition and culture, modern efforts to formalize these principles have brought greater attention to the art and science behind it.
            </div>
            <div class="article__text">
              One of the most notable contributions comes from the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), in the pamphlet "Good Flag, Bad Flag", which outlined five key principles of flag design: simplicity, meaningful symbolism, limited colors, no lettering or seals, and distinctiveness. These guidelines aim to ensure flags are easily recognizable, culturally resonant, and practical for both large displays and smaller reproductions.
            </div>
            <div class="article__text">
              Sometimes, these guidelines are seen as rules to basic flag design, and are applied in order to "rate" the quality of certain flags:

            Criticism of guidelines
          </h2>
          <div class="text__body">
            <div class="article__text">
              The five principles for making a flag mentioned previously have had their fair share of criticism.
            </div>
            <div class="article__text">
              Multiple issues have been raised by opponents of the principles, such as the fact that many great flag designs break them, or that the "quality" of a flag cannot be judged by following some arbitrary rules, but rather by how well it manages to represent a group of people.
            </div>
            <div class="article__text">
              An extensive (and harsh!) criticism of the "Good Flag, Bad Flag" pamphlet was written by a person nicknamed Anne Onimous. You can <a href="https://flagalternatives.com/rubbish/" target="_blank" class="nodec">click here</a> to read it.
            </div>
            <div class="article__text">
              Indeed, some of the flags pictured below break many of the guidelines, yet they can still be considered well-designed. This suggests that the guidelines should be taken with a grain of salt, and used specifically for easily creating a good looking flag without much experience.

It consists of 13 red and white horizontal stripes and 50 white stars on a blue field. The stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the 50 stars symbolize the states in the union. Fun fact: unlike most flags, which either have a 2:3 or 1:2 aspect ratio, the US flag has an unusual 1:1.9 aspect ratio!</td>

The 24-spoke wheel, derived from the Ashoka Pillar, signifies the eternal cycle of life, and was originally proposed by Gandhi in 1921, whose goal was to make Indians self-reliant; to spin cloth for themselves.</td>
